<b><h2>Since I was a kid I started playing Taekwondo with the guidance of my Father who 
happened to be a Coach,Instructor,Poomsae(Demo) Chairman in ARMM and a Division,Regional 
and National Referee of the team I am with.Through this hobby I was given an opportunity 
to travel around the Philippines and went to different amazing tourist spots be it in Luzon,
Visayas or Mindanao!Some says that I am very lucky to be a daughter of Professional Taekwondo 
Official for I can go anywhere because of taekwondo but one thing I wan't them to know,and 
that is,YES,indeed I am lucky to be his Daughter but the oportunity to experienced those places was 
not just about my Father having a high position but also because of my hardworks in every training,winning 
and lossing,that I have experienced all through out this years. </h2></b> </font>

<h2>Whenever I'm in a vacation,I always prefer a place where I can do adventure activities like mountain 
climbing,see diving,trekking,Island hopping and most especially,my favorite is the cliff diving which I 
often do whenever we are at the beach.I don't know why I'm fond of Adventure even there are times that my 
life was at rist.Maybe it is because aside from dreaming,doing adventure activities awakens the excitement 
within me and somehow it became my escape from reality.</h2>
