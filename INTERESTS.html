I became interested in collecting books ever since I stepped on the age of 13.I collected books from every places that I 
visited.For now,I already have 13 books.Those where from Manila,Pasay,Quezon,Laguna,Cebu and Davao City.
Those books served as my souvenirs in every places that I went to, instead of buying keychains and shirts.

<h2><b>
I started to became interested to weapons when I was in Grade 9.It was because of the influenced of the sci-fi 
stories that I've read that was all about zombies made by a chemical that was created by a crazy scientist.
For me that is not possible to happen because of the technologies nowadays.There were drugs created that once intake, 
it will make someone act like a zombie the only different was that,they don't eat flesh of people.Now that made me to collect 
weapons or other sharp objects that can be use for self-defence.Crazy right?Well,there is nothing wrong in being prepared 
in a world full of cruelty.
